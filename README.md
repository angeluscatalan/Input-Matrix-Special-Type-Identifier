OVERVIEW

This JavaScript program accepts user input for matrix dimensions (rows and columns) and generates a matrix. The user can then choose a specific type of matrix to generate, from various common matrix types such as row matrix, column matrix, rectangular matrix, and more.
Features

The program supports the following matrix types:

Row Matrix: A matrix with only one row.

Column Matrix: A matrix with only one column.

Rectangular Matrix: A matrix where the number of rows is different from the number of columns.

Square Matrix: A matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns.

Scalar Matrix: A square matrix where all the diagonal elements are the same, and the off-diagonal elements are zero.

Identity Matrix: A square matrix where all the diagonal elements are 1, and all off-diagonal elements are zero.

Zero Matrix: A matrix where all elements are zero.

Upper Triangular Matrix: A square matrix where all elements below the main diagonal are zero.

Lower Triangular Matrix: A square matrix where all elements above the main diagonal are zero.

HOW TO USE:

Input Dimensions:
1. Enter the number of rows and columns to create a matrix of your desired size.
2. Select Matrix Type: After providing the dimensions, you can select the matrix type you want from the list of supported matrix types.
4. Matrix Generation: The program will generate the matrix based on the selected type, ensuring that the matrix follows the rules of the chosen matrix type.
